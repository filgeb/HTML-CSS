            <h2> profile</h2>
                <p>I am Filagot Gebrewold, I was born in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in 1990. Currently I live in Lund, Sweden with my wife.
                    I am sociable and active person. I am interested in reading historical books, especially something related with my country Ethiopia. I love watching football, travelling, hiking and group games.I studied my bachelorâ€™s degree in animal science in Hawassa university, collage of Agriculture. I also participated in diploma course in Agriculture, Israel. While I was a student in Hawassa University, I have served as a member of graduation class committee by coordinating different tasks. After I finish my study, I worked as a farm supervisor and private taxi diver in Addis. Currently I am taking short coding course at Foocoding, Malmo. I enjoy taking challenges, and now am trying to combine my knowledge in Agriculture with coding.
